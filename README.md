# Integrative Methods of Inquiry in Education: SYMMETRY

## Symposium at Akita International University, Akita Japan

### March 29-30, 2017

Symposium has as its main goal an exchange of views and opinions, sharing knowledge and discussion of the methods to integrate curriculum helping to educate new generations in the manner propagating a holistic world view. Mathematics and increased level of abstraction are natural sources of the methods of unification of knowledge and of curriculum. The concept of symmetry provides an example of the program of unification of the methods of inquiry across virtually all disciplines of human intellectual activity. Whether successful or not, it can serve as a starting point for the discussion of the curricular reforms. We invite contributions to the discussion in the form of oral presentations of relevant papers. [FULL SYNOPSIS](call.md)

### Abstracts (partial list)
  * **Symmetry and Symmetry Breaking in Biology** (Andy Crofts)
Symmetry in the living world is pervasive, yet conveying an engaging and relevant understanding of the mechanism by which it is generated, maintained, and broken, poses many pedagogical challenges. For example, to what extent must students first be introduced to stereochemistry – a subdiscipline of chemistry which addresses the chirality or “handedness” of molecules? This is an important question to consider, since ultimately the three-dimensional shape of organic molecules such as proteins, and the nucleic acids which encode them, plays a central role in determining their biological function. <br />
In addition to addressing this and other questions related to which topics and depth of knowledge may be most appropriate to ensure the active engagement of students, this presentation will also seek to identify and present connecting points to other disciplines, as well as highlight aspects of symmetry that are especially interesting due to their profusion or scarcity in the natural world.
  * **Symmetry as a compression tool** (Attila Egri-Nagy) The precise notion of symmetry underlies most of modern mathematics and several other scientific fields (e.g. physics, chemistry). Despite its fundamental role, symmetry is easy to explain on an intuitive level. The traditional introduction to symmetry operations begins with studying geometrical transformations of regular polygons and polyhedra, then proceeds to the algebraic notation. This approach emphasizes the beauty aspect of symmetry. There is another way based on the notion of efficiency. Here we describe how the simple idea of relabelling elements of a combinatorial structure can make computer programs way faster, and how we can store the same amount of information in less space. For the argument, only the mathematical notion of function is assumed. Therefore, similarly to the geometrical approach, the ideas are accessible without abstract algebra background.
  * **The concept of symmetry in Physics** (Yasushi Nara) The concept of symmetry in physics serves as the most crucial concept, since natural laws are determined by symmetries. Fundamental forces in nature is deduced from the symmetries. Conservation laws in physics is also related to symmetry. One of the most important theorem regarding symmetry is known to be the Noether's theorem (discovered in 1918) that tells us that if there is a symmetry, there is a corresponding conservation law. The first law of thermodynamics is known to be total energy conservation which according to Noether's theorem, is the consequence of the invariance of the natural law in time. I will discuss how to introduce Noether's theorem at an introductory physics course as a part of Liberal Arts education.
  * **Structuralism - Its prominent past, sad present, and bright future** (Marcin Schroeder)
